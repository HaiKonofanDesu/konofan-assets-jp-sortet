To make the Navigation a bit easier here is a secret:

All the Numbers (like 1001100) can be separated into 3 parts
- The first 3 Letters (100) -> This is the Character ID
- The 4th letter (1) -> This refers to rarity of the Unit (so either 1, 2, 3 or 4)  
- The last 3 letters (100) -> This refers to the event/season it was from.

Here are all Character IDs:

Here you should find any Icon you might want! Weapons, Skills, Chars etc. you name it you find it here! Most Folder names should be pretty straight forward. If not let me know and I can try to explain it more!

**Spines**

If you want to make some cool GIFs using the SpineViewer you can find all the files you need here! Just keep in mind that you need to rename some files.

Tutorial on how to use them:
1. Locate the SpineModels Folder
2. Open Folder for Unit of interest
3. Rename the id.txt file to id.json
4. Copy the .atlas, .png and .json file (from step 3)
5. Load the 3 files into a Spine Viewer
